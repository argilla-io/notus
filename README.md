# ðŸ’¨ Notus 7B: DPO fine-tune of Zephyr 7B SFT

Introduction (WIP)

## Installation (WIP)
```shell
...

> **Warning**
> When trying to run the scripts mentioned above and also the ones defined in the original `alignment-handbook`, we found out that the `bitsandbytes` dependency was running into some issues with the environment variable `GOOGLE_VM_CONFIG_LOCK_FILE`, so if you are running on GCP you should edit the `bitsandbytes/cuda_setup/env_vars.py` file to include the environment variable within the `to_be_ignored` function.

  ```diff
  def to_be_ignored(env_var: str, value: str) -> bool:
      ignorable = {
          "PWD",  # PWD: this is how the shell keeps track of the current working dir
          "OLDPWD",
          "SSH_AUTH_SOCK",  # SSH stuff, therefore unrelated
          "SSH_TTY",
          "HOME",  # Linux shell default
          "TMUX",  # Terminal Multiplexer
